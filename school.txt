Home is the place where we get uninterrupted supply of all the things of our


physical, emotional, social, psychological and spiritual needs. At home we

really feel ‘at home’. The love and care of our parents nurtures us and keeps

us safe. Without our home we would be like a tree without roots.

Similarly, our school is like our second home where we feel

at home. We meet enlightened teachers who impart us the light of knowledge and


thus illumine our world which would remain dark without them. We also meet our

friends in the form of our classmates who make our world colourful and vibrant

with their friendship and cooperation. 

At school we get the exposure to participate in various

academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities which hones our

personality. We get all round training at school. Our time just flies at

school. The school years pass at a fast pace doing meaningful and skill

development activities. 

In conclusion we can say that school indeed is our second

home where we spend maximum of our time in the company of parents like teachers

and sibling like peers. Without this second home we would not be half as

civilized as we are.
